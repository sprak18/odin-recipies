# odin-recipies
This is my first real web dev project. I'm using basic HTML knowledge to create this one.
# final-update
I've created 3 basic HTML pages and linked them to index.html. The project wasn't particiularly challenging in terms of code (HTML) but it helped me learn a lot about git and github workflow, adding and commiting changes, and pushing them to the remote repository.
