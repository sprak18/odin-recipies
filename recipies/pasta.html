    <h3>To Die For Fettuccine Alfredo!</h3>
    <p>I created this fettuccine Alfredo by modifying my mother's recipe. I get nothing but rave reviews when I make this dish. My boyfriend is a fettuccine Alfredo connoisseur, and he scrapes the pan every time. I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health-conscious!</p>
    <p>The total prep time for this dish is around 15 minutes, with an additional cook time of 15 more minutes. This recipe can serve upto 6 people.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>24 ounces dry fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>3/4th pint heavy cream</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 dash garlic salt</li>
        <li>3/4th cup grated Romano cheese</li>
        <li>half cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccine and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</p></li>
        <li><p>Melt butter into cream in a large saucepan over low heat; add salt, pepper, and garlic salt. Increase the heat to medium; stir in grated Romano and Parmesan cheese until melted and sauce has thickened.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add cooked pasta to sauce and toss until thoroughly coated; serve immediately.</p></li>
    </ol>
