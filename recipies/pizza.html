        <li>1/4th cup warm water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons shortening</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Combine 4 cups bread flour, beer, water, shortening, yeast, brown sugar, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment; mix until combined. With the mixer running, add remaining flour, a little at a time, until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms into a ball, about 2 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Lightly grease a large bowl with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Place dough into the bowl. Cover with a clean towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</p></li>
        <li><p>Grease 2 pizza pans with remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil; dust with cornmeal.</p></li>
        <li><p>Punch dough down gently and divide into 2 equal portions. Place each portion onto a prepared pan. Cover and let rest for about 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stretch each dough out 1 inch past the edge of the pan. If dough shrinks back when stretched, cover and let rest for 5 more minutes before stretching again.</p></li>
        <li><p>Arrange 8 sticks cheese, ends touching, around the edge of 1 pan. Fold overhang over cheese and press dough to seal. Repeat with the second pan.</p></li>
